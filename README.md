## Task Board

### Intro
As part of my time management strategy, I group my daily tasks into groups according to the type of task; therefore, I took advantage of this home assignment to develop this tool.

### So what did I build?
- Frontend & backend of a Kanban Board
- Drag & drop abilities for faster ux, which I've developed by myself (a bit buggy but good enough)
- Editing & adding & removing the tasks
- Editing the column name
- Double tap on a task will mark it as necessary (toggle)

### What do you need to do?
Run both API and web separately by following the instructions on their README files

### What I didn't manage to do - due to the time limit
- Add Docker file
- Deploy project to production
