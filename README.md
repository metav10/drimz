## Task Board

### Intro
In order to manage my time proparly I'm grouping my daily tasks into groups based on the type of the task, 
so I took adventage of this home assigment to develop a tool I need.

### So what did I build?
- Frontend & backend of a Kanban Board
- Drag & drop abilities for faster ux, which I've developed by my self (a bit buggy but good enough)
- Editing & adding & removing the tasks
- Editing the column name
- Double tap on a task will mark it as important (toggle)
